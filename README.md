# Health & Wellness Data Science Project

This project combines a frontend health dashboard and a Python-based data analysis system  
to explore how wellness habits like hydration, sleep, and BMI affect daily productivity

Part 1 — Health Assistant Dashboard
Tech: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Tracks daily water intake, BMI, and schedules.
- Demonstrates frontend development and logic implementation.
- Exports or simulates data for later analysis.

Part 2 — Wellness Data Analysis & Prediction
Tech: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- Performs data cleaning, visualization, and correlation analysis.
- Builds a **Linear Regression model to predict productivity based on water intake and sleep hours.
- Visualizes results with scatter plots and heatmaps.
